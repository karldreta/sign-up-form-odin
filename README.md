An Odin Project: Sign-up Form

## 20 May 2024

## The first project of the JS Path.
* In here I will create a Sign-up Form using the things I learned in the 
    beginning of this Path so far.

## Objectives
* Upon finishing the project, I should have grasped:
    * Creating Forms
    * Styling Forms
    * Validating Forms

## Let's see how we do...

## 23 May 2024 @ 3AM: Finished the Project

* I followed the provided form format: [Project reference](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/5f37d43908ef92499e95a9b90fc3cc291a95014c/html_css/project-sign-up-form/sign-up-form.png).

* But I added my own twist, I created a fictional form landing page for a Gym Membership.
* The [Agoge](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agoge#:~:text=The%20agoge%20(Greek%3A%20%E1%BC%80%CE%B3%CF%89%CE%B3%CE%AE%2C,ruling%20houses%2C%20Eurypontid%20and%20Agiad.>), was the rigorous education and training program mandated for all Spartan male. 
* For the past couple months of grinding code and working, both of which requires sitting on desks majority of the time, I've forgotten to be active, and that's how the idea for the site came to me. 
* Recently, I've just gotten back to exercising ðŸ˜ƒ.

## What I learned:

* I've now known how to structure a form and to style each elements. I've grasped:
    * Pseudo-classes,
    * Selectors (classes, IDs, chaining, etc.)

* Validation using JavaScript, this one is my favorite part. Even though it wasn't mandatory to move forward with the project (i.e. I could have just added some constraints like <em>required</em>), but I really wanted to do it so that I won't have that browser validator with the default <strong>[ ! ]</strong>, making my site look generic.

* I thought it would be difficult, but a few couple ```if statements``` later and voila!
